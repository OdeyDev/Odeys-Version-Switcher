# Odeys-Mod-Switcher

A common problem I had was when I wanted to use another version of minecraft with a different set of mods
I would have to rename the new one to mods and rename the other one back and I just wanted to play.

I made this mod to make it as easy as a simple button press to swap mod folders. I hope you find it helpful! :D
